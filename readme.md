# [Bale Bot](https://dev.bale.ai/api/) Api Client in Nim ðŸ‘‘

## Features
+ ***fast***: no mapping or intermidiate representation, just stores `JsonNode`s as `distinct` ones.
+ ***safe***: compile time checks & Auto-completes!! 
+ ***extensible***: the docs updated or I missed some APIs/fields? No problem! just add your own function becuase it's all `JsonNode`s and functions! it's just one file man.

## How to Use
see `./tests/test1.nim` at the moments
